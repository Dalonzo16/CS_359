This is the README file for Part 3 of our project of creating a database for the "XYZ Gym".

The objectives for this stage were to write SQL statements to search for and retrieve information from the database and to write a python program to connect to the SQLite database and execute SQL queries. 

Work Allocation:
    - Ludwig Scherer: Database connection function, command line argument preparation and main function skeleton
    - Alena Fisher: Wrote queries for questions 6-10, added necessary information into the database for the queries, and created Execution.pdf. 
    - Devon Alonzo: Wrote queries for questions 1-5 and also added more information to the database

Project leader for this stage was: Alena Fisher
