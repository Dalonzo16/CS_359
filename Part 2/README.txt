This is the README file for Part 2 of our project of creating a database for the "XYZ Gym".

The objective for this stage was to write SQL DDL statements to creat the necessary tables and their constraints,
and to compose SQL DML statements to insert some data into the database.

Work allocations was as follows:
    - Task 1: Implement the database using SQLite3 (Alena Fisher)
    - Task 2: Insert into each table at least 5 records (Devon Alonzo)
    - Task 3: Create a README.txt (Ludwig Scherer)
    - Task 4: Create Schemas.pdf file (Ludwig Scherer)

Project leader for stage to was: Alena Fisher
